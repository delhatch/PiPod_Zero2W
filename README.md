# PiPod_Zero2W
This project started as a clone of https://github.com/BramRausch/PiPod
<H3>Motication</H3>
<p>I created this version to:</p>
<ul><li>Change from the Raspberry Pi Zero to the Pi Zero 2 W.</li>
<li>To document all of the steps necessary to create the PiPod from scratch, starting with a new Pi Zero 2 W</li></ul>
<p>THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT!</p>
<p>Lots of things are changing daily as I adapt the software, and what the developer needs to do to make it all work together.</p>
<H3>Hardware changes</H3>
<ul><li>Increase R6 to 3.75 kOhm to reduce the battery charging current to 325 mA (= 0.28C)</li>
<li>Increase R9 to 4.7 kohm to reduce the brightness of the green LED</li></ul>
