# PiPod_Zero2W
This project is a clone of https://github.com/BramRausch/PiPod
<p>I am modifying the following:</p>
<p>1) This project uses the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W instead of the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
<p>2) I will document all of the steps necessary to create a PiPod starting with a new Pi Zero 2 W</p>
<p>THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT!</p>
<p>Lots of things are changing daily as I adapt the software, and what the developer needs to do to make it all work together.</p>
